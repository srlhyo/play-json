# Demoing with JSON

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation, a lightweight format for structuring data. It is used to transmitting data between sever and web applications, as an alternative to XML. It's powerful easy-acess makes it the preference among developers and for that reason, I decided to create a repo where each branch, except _master_ and _develop_, will be a demo on using different approches for loading data into the pages using **Json**.

# Where it is going...

At the moment, I am using the platform to practice loading data with json, using different tecniques and on different languages; perhaps `php` and `javascript` since they are the most used ones in my development journey. Then, once I feel more confident, I will building a web app and deploy it for the world to see.
